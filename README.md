### About

Howtube is a reddit style user community focused on video tutorials. Users can create a post by submitting the Youtube link to their favorite video tutorials. Community members can then watch the tutorial in the community feed and upvote/downvote it. Search results are sorted by cached vote score so users will find the community's favorite video on their topic first. Howtube also has cross platform integration in the form of a Slackbot. Users can utilize the slash command /howtube with a search inquiry and the Slackbot will respond with Howtube's top result as an embedded video directly in the channel.
